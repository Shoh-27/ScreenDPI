            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Screen DPI Checker was created to provide designers, developers, and digital professionals with an accurate, easy-to-use tool for measuring their display's pixel density and physical dimensions. We believe that understanding your screen's specifications is essential for creating pixel-perfect designs and developing responsive applications.</p>

            <h2>Why We Built This Tool</h2>
            <p>Modern displays come in a wide variety of sizes and resolutions, from standard 1080p monitors to ultra-high-resolution 4K and 5K displays. This diversity makes it challenging for professionals to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accurately preview how designs will appear on different devices</li>
                <li>Test responsive layouts across various screen densities</li>
                <li>Understand the true pixel density of their workspace</li>
                <li>Make informed decisions when purchasing new displays</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Operating systems typically report a standardized DPI value (like 96 or 72) regardless of your actual screen density. This legacy approach doesn't reflect the true physical characteristics of modern displays. Our tool calculates your actual, physical pixel density using precise calibration methods.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            
            <h3>Automatic Detection</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, the tool automatically detects your screen resolution, device pixel ratio, browser type, and operating system. This information is processed entirely in your web browser — nothing is sent to our servers.</p>

            <h3>Calibration Methods</h3>
            <p>We offer two calibration methods to determine your screen's physical size:</p>
            
            <h4>Credit Card Calibration (Recommended)</h4>
            <p>This method uses a standard credit card as a physical reference. Credit cards follow the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard, measuring exactly 85.6mm × 53.98mm. By adjusting an on-screen rectangle to match your physical card, the tool can calculate your screen's DPI with exceptional accuracy.</p>

            <h4>Manual Entry</h4>
            <p>If you know your screen's diagonal size (typically listed in product specifications), you can enter it directly. The tool then calculates your DPI using the Pythagorean theorem based on your screen resolution.</p>

            <h3>Privacy-First Design</h3>
            <p>All calculations are performed locally in your browser using JavaScript. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or measurement data to our servers. Your privacy is our priority.</p>

            <h2>Who Uses This Tool</h2>

            <h2>Accuracy and Reliability</h2>
            <p>We take accuracy seriously. Our tool uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ISO Standard Reference:</strong> Credit card calibration based on international standards</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Calculations:</strong> Mathematical formulas that account for device pixel ratio and resolution</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> Testing across all major browsers to ensure consistent results</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Continuous improvement based on user feedback and technological changes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Free and Always Will Be</h2>
            <p>Screen DPI Checker is and will remain completely free to use. We believe essential professional tools should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget.</p>
            
            <p>To support the hosting and maintenance of this tool, we display non-intrusive advertisements and include affiliate links to quality products we genuinely recommend. These monetization methods allow us to keep the tool free while maintaining it for the long term.</p>

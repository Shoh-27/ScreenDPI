        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <p>Before you begin measuring your monitor, gather these tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Measuring tape or ruler:</strong> Preferably one that shows both inches and centimeters</li>
            <li><strong>Pen and paper:</strong> For recording your measurements</li>
            <li><strong>Calculator:</strong> Optional, for converting units or calculating dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Clean cloth:</strong> To wipe the screen if needed for better visibility</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> A flexible measuring tape works better than a rigid ruler, especially for curved screens or measuring diagonals on larger monitors.</p>

        <h2>Method 1: Measuring Diagonal Size (Standard Method)</h2>
        <p>Monitor size is traditionally measured diagonally from corner to corner. This is the measurement manufacturers use when advertising screen size (24", 27", 32", etc.).</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Turn off your monitor:</strong> This makes the screen edges more visible. A black screen shows exactly where the display area ends.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Identify the visible screen area:</strong> Look for where the actual display ends and the bezel (plastic frame) begins. You should only measure the lit display area, not the frame.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose your starting corner:</strong> It doesn't matter which corner you start from. Most people find bottom-left to top-right easiest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Place the measuring tape:</strong> Position the tape measure's zero mark at the very corner of the visible display area (not the outer edge of the bezel).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Extend to opposite corner:</strong> Stretch the tape diagonally across the screen to the opposite corner. Keep it taut and straight.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Read the measurement:</strong> Note where the tape meets the opposite corner. This is your diagonal screen size.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Record in inches:</strong> Most screen sizes are expressed in inches. If you measured in centimeters, divide by 2.54 to convert.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Including the bezel:</strong> Only measure the screen itself, not the plastic frame</li>
            <li><strong>Measuring horizontally or vertically:</strong> Screen size is always diagonal</li>
            <li><strong>Letting the tape sag:</strong> Keep it taut for an accurate measurement</li>
            <li><strong>Rounding too much:</strong> Be precise to the nearest tenth of an inch (e.g., 27.2")</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method 2: Measuring Width and Height</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you need the exact width and height measurements, not just the diagonal. This is useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating screen area</li>
            <li>Checking if a monitor fits a specific space</li>
            <li>Comparing aspect ratios</li>
            <li>Ordering screen protectors or privacy filters</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Measure Width</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your measuring tape at the left edge of the visible screen</li>
            <li>Extend it horizontally across to the right edge</li>
            <li>Keep the tape parallel to the top and bottom edges</li>
            <li>Record the measurement to the nearest 0.1 inch</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Measure Height</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your measuring tape at the bottom edge of the visible screen</li>
            <li>Extend it vertically to the top edge</li>
            <li>Keep the tape parallel to the left and right edges</li>
            <li>Record the measurement to the nearest 0.1 inch</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Common Screen Dimensions by Diagonal Size</h3>
        <p>For standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitors:</p>
        <table>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Method 3: Using Manufacturer Specifications</h2>
        <p>If you don't have a measuring tape handy, you can look up your monitor's exact specifications:</p>

        <h3>Finding Your Model Number</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check the back of the monitor:</strong> There's usually a sticker with the model number</li>
            <li><strong>Look at the front bezel:</strong> Some monitors have the model printed near the power button</li>
            <li><strong>Check your purchase receipt or box:</strong> The model number is always listed</li>
            <li><strong>Use system settings:</strong> On Windows, go to Settings → System → Display → Advanced display settings</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Looking Up Specifications Online</h3>
        <p>Once you have the model number (e.g., "Dell U2723DE" or "LG 27UK850"):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search "[model number] specifications" in Google</li>
            <li>Visit the manufacturer's official website</li>
            <li>Look for "Screen Size" or "Display Diagonal"</li>
            <li>Also check "Active Display Area" for exact dimensions</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Manufacturer specifications sometimes round measurements. A monitor advertised as "27 inches" might actually be 27.2" or 26.9" diagonally.</p>

        <h2>Calculating Dimensions from Diagonal and Aspect Ratio</h2>
        <p>If you know your diagonal size and aspect ratio, you can calculate width and height mathematically.</p>

        <h3>For 16:9 Aspect Ratio (Most Common)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Diagonal × 0.8716</li>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> Diagonal × 0.4903</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example for 27" monitor:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Width: 27 × 0.8716 = 23.5 inches</li>
            <li>Height: 27 × 0.4903 = 13.2 inches</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For 16:10 Aspect Ratio</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Diagonal × 0.8514</li>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> Diagonal × 0.5321</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For 21:9 Ultrawide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Diagonal × 0.9225</li>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> Diagonal × 0.3857</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For 4:3 Aspect Ratio (Older Monitors)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Diagonal × 0.8</li>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> Diagonal × 0.6</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Calculating Screen Area</h2>
        <p>Screen area is useful for comparing how much visual space different monitors provide.</p>

        <h3>Formula</h3>
        <p><strong>Screen Area = Width × Height</strong></p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Monitor</th>
                <th>Dimensions</th>
                <th>Calculation</th>
                <th>Total Area</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>24" (16:9)</td>
                <td>20.9" × 11.8"</td>
                <td>20.9 × 11.8</td>
                <td>246 sq in</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>27" (16:9)</td>
                <td>23.5" × 13.2"</td>
                <td>23.5 × 13.2</td>
                <td>310 sq in</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>32" (16:9)</td>
                <td>27.9" × 15.7"</td>
                <td>27.9 × 15.7</td>
                <td>438 sq in</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>34" (21:9)</td>
                <td>31.4" × 13.1"</td>
                <td>31.4 × 13.1</td>
                <td>411 sq in</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Interesting comparison:</strong> A 34" ultrawide monitor (21:9) has about the same screen area as a 27" standard monitor (16:9) — just arranged differently!</p>

        <h2>Special Cases: Curved and Ultrawide Monitors</h2>

        <h3>Measuring Curved Monitors</h3>
        <p>Curved monitors require special attention:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use a flexible measuring tape:</strong> Rigid rulers won't work well</li>
            <li><strong>Follow the curve:</strong> Let the tape curve naturally along the screen surface</li>
            <li><strong>For diagonal:</strong> Measure from corner to corner along the curve</li>
            <li><strong>For width:</strong> Measure the actual curved distance, not straight across</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Manufacturer specs for curved monitors usually give the "flat equivalent" diagonal measurement, not the actual curved distance.</p>

        <h3>Ultrawide Monitors</h3>
        <p>Ultrawide monitors (21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios) are wider than standard monitors with the same diagonal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>34" ultrawide ≈ width of 40" standard monitor, but shorter height</li>
            <li>49" super ultrawide (32:9) ≈ two 27" monitors side by side</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method 4: Using Our DPI Calculator</h2>
        <p>The easiest and most accurate method: Use our <a href="/">Screen DPI Calculator</a> with credit card calibration.</p>

        <h3>Why This Method is Best</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No physical measuring needed:</strong> Uses a standard credit card as reference</li>
            <li><strong>Extremely accurate:</strong> Within 1-2% of actual size</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic calculations:</strong> Gives you diagonal, width, height, and DPI</li>
            <li><strong>Works on any screen:</strong> Desktop, laptop, tablet</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit our <a href="/">DPI Calculator</a></li>
            <li>Select "Credit Card Calibration"</li>
            <li>Adjust the on-screen rectangle to match your physical credit card</li>
            <li>Click "Calibrate"</li>
            <li>Get instant results with all dimensions</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

        <h3>For Desk Setup Planning</h3>
        <p>Knowing exact dimensions helps you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the right monitor arm or stand</li>
            <li>Ensure the monitor fits your desk space</li>
            <li>Plan multi-monitor setups accurately</li>
            <li>Maintain proper viewing distance (1.5× to 2× diagonal is recommended)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Accessory Shopping</h3>
        <p>Accurate measurements ensure proper fit for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen protectors</li>
            <li>Privacy filters</li>
            <li>Monitor hoods (for photo/video editing)</li>
            <li>Carrying cases or covers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Comparing Monitors</h3>
        <p>Screen area gives a better comparison than diagonal alone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 34" ultrawide has less area than a 32" standard monitor</li>
            <li>Two 24" monitors provide 492 sq in vs. 438 sq in for one 32" monitor</li>
            <li>Aspect ratio significantly affects usable space</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Accurate Measurements</h2>

        <h3>Do's</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✓ Use a flexible measuring tape for best results</li>
            <li>✓ Measure the visible screen area only, not the bezel</li>
            <li>✓ Take measurements with the screen turned off for visibility</li>
            <li>✓ Measure twice to verify accuracy</li>
            <li>✓ Record measurements immediately to avoid forgetting</li>
            <li>✓ Use the metric system if you're more comfortable, then convert</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Don'ts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✗ Don't include the bezel/frame in your measurement</li>
            <li>✗ Don't measure horizontally or vertically when you need diagonal</li>
            <li>✗ Don't rely on rounded manufacturer specs if precision matters</li>
            <li>✗ Don't forget to account for screen curvature on curved monitors</li>
            <li>✗ Don't use damaged or stretched measuring tapes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

        <h3>My measurement doesn't match the advertised size</h3>
        <p><strong>This is normal.</strong> Manufacturers round to the nearest whole number. A "27-inch" monitor might actually be 27.2" or 26.9" when measured precisely.</p>

        <h3>I can't see where the screen ends</h3>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Turn off the monitor completely. The black screen makes the border between display and bezel much more visible.</p>

        <h3>My curved monitor measurement seems wrong</h3>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Curved monitors are measured by their "flat equivalent" diagonal, not the actual curved surface distance. Your measurement might be longer if you followed the curve.</p>

        <h3>I don't have a measuring tape</h3>
        <p><strong>Alternatives:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a piece of string, then measure the string against a ruler</li>
            <li>Check your monitor's model number and look up specs online</li>
            <li>Use our <a href="/">DPI Calculator</a> with credit card calibration (no measuring needed!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Measuring your monitor size accurately is straightforward once you know the proper technique. Whether you use a measuring tape, manufacturer specs, or our credit card calibration method, you now have multiple ways to determine your exact screen dimensions.</p>
        <p>For the quickest and most accurate results without any physical measuring, try our <a href="/">Screen DPI Calculator</a> — it automatically calculates all dimensions and gives you your screen's pixel density as a bonus!</p>

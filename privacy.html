            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Screen DPI Checker ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website and services.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>Our tool automatically detects certain technical information about your device to provide its core functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong> The width and height of your display in pixels</li>
                <li><strong>Device Pixel Ratio:</strong> The ratio between physical and logical pixels</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Type:</strong> The web browser you are using</li>
                <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> The operating system running on your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> All of this information is processed entirely in your web browser. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of this information to our servers or any third parties.</p>

            <h3>Calibration Data</h3>
            <p>When you use the credit card calibration feature or manually enter your screen size, these measurements are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processed locally in your browser</li>
                <li>Used only for calculating your screen's DPI</li>
                <li>Never stored permanently</li>
                <li>Never sent to any server</li>
                <li>Cleared when you close or refresh the page</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>We may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you. These services include:</p>
            
            <h4>Google AdSense</h4>
            <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Ad Settings</a>.</p>

            <h4>Affiliate Links</h4>
            <p>Our website contains affiliate links to third-party retailers (such as Amazon). When you click these links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. These third-party sites have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>

            <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            
            <h3>Our Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our website does not set any first-party cookies for tracking purposes. Any cookies present may be from third-party services such as:</p>

                <li>Google AdSense (for ad delivery and personalization)</li>
                <li>Affiliate networks (for tracking referrals)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Control Cookies</h3>
            <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. However, if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>Since we do not collect personal information through our tool, there is no data to use, share, or sell. The only data processing that occurs is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Displaying calculations based on your screen specifications</li>
                <li>Showing relevant advertisements through Google AdSense</li>
                <li>Tracking affiliate referrals when you click product links</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take data security seriously. Since our tool operates entirely in your browser without transmitting data to our servers, there is no risk of your screen measurements being intercepted or stored by us. However, please be aware that third-party services (like ad networks) may collect data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            <h2>International Users</h2>

If you are accessing our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located. However, since we do not collect or store personal information through our tool, this transfer risk is minimal.</p>
